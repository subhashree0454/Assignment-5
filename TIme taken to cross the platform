To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Speed of the Train

The train crosses a pole in 12 seconds. The length of the train is 240 meters.

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{240 \text{ meters}}{12 \text{ seconds}} = 20 \text{ m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Distance to Cross the Platform

When the train crosses a platform, the distance to cover is the length of the train plus the length of the platform.

Length of the platform = 400 meters, so:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 240 \text{ meters} + 400 \text{ meters} = 640 \text{ meters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Time to Cross the Platform

Using the speed calculated:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{640 \text{ meters}}{20 \text{ m/s}} = 32 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Conclusion

The time taken to cross the platform is **32 seconds**.

### Final Answer

**None of the options provided are correct.** The calculated time is **32 seconds**.
