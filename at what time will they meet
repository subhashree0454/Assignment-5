To find the time when the two trains will meet, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
- Distance between stations P and Q = 110 km
- Speed of Train from P = 20 km/h
- Speed of Train from Q = 25 km/h
- Train from P starts at 7:00 a.m.
- Train from Q starts at 8:00 a.m.

### Step 1: Calculate the time difference

The train from P starts 1 hour earlier than the train from Q. In that hour, the distance covered by the train from P is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 20 \text{ km/h} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 20 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 2: Remaining distance between the trains when Train Q starts

After 1 hour, the remaining distance between the two trains is:
\[
\text{Remaining Distance} = 110 \text{ km} - 20 \text{ km} = 90 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the relative speed of both trains

When both trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is:
\[
\text{Relative Speed} = 20 \text{ km/h} + 25 \text{ km/h} = 45 \text{ km/h}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the time to meet

Using the remaining distance and the relative speed, we can calculate the time taken to meet:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{90 \text{ km}}{45 \text{ km/h}} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the meeting time

Since Train Q starts at 8:00 a.m., adding 2 hours to this time gives:
\[
\text{Meeting Time} = 8:00 \text{ a.m.} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10:00 \text{ a.m.}
\]

### Final Answer:

**B. 10:00**
