To find the time it takes for two trains to cross each other, we can use the information provided:

### Given:

- **Time taken by Train A to pass a pole** = 18 seconds
- **Time taken by Train B to pass a pole** = 12 seconds

### Step 1: Calculate the lengths of the trains

Let \( L \) be the length of each train.

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

1. For Train A:
\[
S_A = \frac{L}{18}
\]

2. For Train B:
\[
S_B = \frac{L}{12}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the speeds of the trains

From the lengths:
- Speed of Train A:
\[
S_A = \frac{L}{18}
\]

- Speed of Train B:
\[
S_B = \frac{L}{12}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the relative speed

When the trains are running in opposite directions, the relative speed is:
\[
S_{relative} = S_A + S_B = \frac{L}{18} + \frac{L}{12}
\]

To add these, find a common denominator (which is 36):
\[
S_{relative} = \frac{2L}{36} + \frac{3L}{36} = \frac{5L}{36}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the time to cross each other

When the trains cross each other, the total distance covered is \( L + L = 2L \):
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} = \frac{2L}{\frac{5L}{36}} = \frac{2L \times 36}{5L} = \frac{72}{5} = 14.4 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Final Answer:

**A. 14.4 seconds**
