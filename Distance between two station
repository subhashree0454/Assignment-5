To find the distance between the two stations, let's denote:

- Speed of Train P = 40 km/hr
- Speed of Train Q = 45 km/hr

### Step 1: Let the distance covered by Train P be \( x \) km.

According to the problem, when the trains meet, Train Q has covered 20 km more than Train P. Thus, the distance covered by Train Q can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Distance covered by Train Q} = x + 20 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 2: Using the relation of distance and speed

The time taken by both trains to meet can be expressed using the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For Train P:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{x}{40}
\]

For Train Q:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{x + 20}{45}
\]

### Step 3: Setting the time equations equal

Since both trains meet at the same time, we can set the equations equal to each other:
\[
\frac{x}{40} = \frac{x + 20}{45}
\]

### Step 4: Cross-multiplying to solve for \( x \)

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
45x = 40(x + 20)
\]
\[
45x = 40x + 800
\]
\[
45x - 40x = 800
\]
\[
5x = 800
\]
\[
x = 160 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 5: Finding the distance covered by Train Q

The distance covered by Train Q is:
\[
x + 20 = 160 + 20 = 180 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 6: Total distance between the two stations

The total distance between stations P and Q is:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance covered by Train P} + \text{Distance covered by Train Q}
\]
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 160 + 180 = 340 \text{ km}
\]

### Conclusion

The distance between the two stations is **340 km**.

### Final Answer:

**C. 340 km**
