### Let:
- Speed of Train A = \( S_A \)
- Speed of Train B = \( S_B \)

### Given:
- Time taken by Train A to cross the man = 36 seconds
- Time taken by Train B to cross the man = 26 seconds
- Time taken by the two trains to cross each other = 30 seconds

### Step 1: Calculate lengths of the trains

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Length} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

1. For Train A:
\[
L_A = S_A \times 36
\]

2. For Train B:
\[
L_B = S_B \times 26
\]

### Step 2: When they cross each other

When the trains cross each other, the combined length is:
\[
L_A + L_B = (S_A \times 36) + (S_B \times 26)
\]

This distance is covered in 30 seconds:
\[
L_A + L_B = (S_A + S_B) \times 30
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equations

From the lengths:
\[
S_A \times 36 + S_B \times 26 = (S_A + S_B) \times 30
\]

### Step 4: Substitute \( L_A \) and \( L_B \)

This simplifies to:
\[
36S_A + 26S_B = 30S_A + 30S_B
\]

Rearranging gives:
\[
36S_A - 30S_A = 30S_B - 26S_B
\]
\[
6S_A = 4S_B
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the ratio

Thus, the ratio of their speeds is:
\[
\frac{S_A}{S_B} = \frac{4}{6} \Rightarrow \frac{2}{3}
\]

### Conclusion:

The ratio of the speeds of the two trains is **2:3**.

### Final Answer:
**None of the options are correct.** The ratio is **2:3**.
