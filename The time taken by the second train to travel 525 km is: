To find the time taken by the second train to travel 525 km, we first need to calculate the average speed of the first train.

### Step 1: Calculate the average speed of the first train

The first train travels from P to Q at 126 km/h and returns at 90 km/h. The average speed can be calculated using the formula for average speed:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2 \times S_1 \times S_2}{S_1 + S_2}
\]
Where:
- \( S_1 = 126 \) km/h
- \( S_2 = 90 \) km/h

Calculating the average speed:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{2 \times 126 \times 90}{126 + 90} = \frac{22680}{216} \approx 105 \text{ km/h}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken by the second train

The second train travels at the average speed of the first train, which is 105 km/h. To find the time taken to travel 525 km, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{525}{105} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer:

**A. 5 hours**
