To find the distance between stations A and B, let's denote the distance as \( D \) km and the speed of the train as \( S \) km/h.

### Step 1: Convert time from minutes to hours

1. **Time for first trip**: 
   \[
   \text{Time}_1 = 45 \text{ min} = \frac{45}{60} = 0.75 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Time for second trip**: 
   \[
   \text{Time}_2 = 48 \text{ min} = \frac{48}{60} = 0.8 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Step 2: Set up the equations based on speed and distance

Using the formula \( \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \):

1. For the first trip:
   \[
   D = S \times 0.75 \quad \text{(1)}
   \]

2. For the second trip with reduced speed:
   \[
   D = (S - 5) \times 0.8 \quad \text{(2)}
   \]

### Step 3: Set the two expressions for distance equal

From (1) and (2):
\[
S \times 0.75 = (S - 5) \times 0.8
\]

### Step 4: Expand and rearrange the equation

Expanding:
\[
0.75S = 0.8S - 4
\]

Rearranging gives:
\[
4 = 0.8S - 0.75S
\]
\[
4 = 0.05S
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( S \)

\[
S = \frac{4}{0.05} = 80 \text{ km/h}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the distance \( D \)

Using \( S \) in equation (1):
\[
D = S \times 0.75 = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ km}
\]

### Final Answer:

**C. 60**
