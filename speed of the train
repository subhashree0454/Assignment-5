To find the speed of the train, we can use the information provided about how long it takes the train to pass a telegraph post and a bridge.

### Given:

1. **Length of the bridge** = 264 meters
2. **Time to pass the telegraph post** = 8 seconds
3. **Time to pass the bridge** = 20 seconds

### Step 1: Calculate the speed using the telegraph post

When passing the telegraph post, the distance covered is equal to the length of the train. Let \( L \) be the length of the train.

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]
For the telegraph post:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{L}{8}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the speed using the bridge

When passing the bridge, the distance covered is equal to the length of the train plus the length of the bridge:
\[
\text{Distance} = L + 264
\]
Using the time to pass the bridge:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{L + 264}{20}
\]

### Step 3: Set the two speed equations equal

Since both speeds are equal, we can set the equations equal to each other:
\[
\frac{L}{8} = \frac{L + 264}{20}
\]

### Step 4: Cross-multiply to solve for \( L \)

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
20L = 8(L + 264)
\]
\[
20L = 8L + 2112
\]
\[
20L - 8L = 2112
\]
\[
12L = 2112
\]
\[
L = \frac{2112}{12} = 176 \text{ meters}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the speed of the train

Using the length of the train to find the speed:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{L}{8} = \frac{176}{8} = 22 \text{ m/s}
\]

### Step 6: Convert speed to km/hr

To convert m/s to km/hr, use the formula:
\[
\text{Speed in km/hr} = \text{Speed in m/s} \times \frac{18}{5}
\]
\[
\text{Speed} = 22 \times \frac{18}{5} = 79.2 \text{ km/hr}
\]

### Final Answer:

**D. 79.2 km/hr**
