To find the length of the other train, we can use the information given about the speeds and the time taken to cross each other.

### Given:
- Length of Train A = 270 meters
- Speed of Train A = 120 km/h
- Speed of Train B = 80 km/h
- Time taken to cross each other = 9 seconds

### Step 1: Convert speeds to meters per second

To convert km/h to m/s, use:
\[
\text{Speed in m/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in km/h} \times 5}{18}
\]

- Speed of Train A:
\[
120 \text{ km/h} = \frac{120 \times 5}{18} \approx 33.33 \text{ m/s}
\]

- Speed of Train B:
\[
80 \text{ km/h} = \frac{80 \times 5}{18} \approx 22.22 \text{ m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the relative speed

When the trains are moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is:
\[
S_{\text{relative}} = S_A + S_B = 33.33 + 22.22 \approx 55.55 \text{ m/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance covered while crossing

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
The distance covered while crossing each other is:
\[
\text{Distance} = S_{\text{relative}} \times \text{Time} = 55.55 \times 9 \approx 500 \text{ meters}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the length of the other train

The total distance covered is the sum of the lengths of both trains:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Length of Train A} + \text{Length of Train B}
\]
\[
500 = 270 + L_B
\]
Where \( L_B \) is the length of the other train.

Thus,
\[
L_B = 500 - 270 = 230 \text{ meters}
\]

### Final Answer:

**A. 230 m**
