Lengths of the trains:

Train A = 125 meters
Train B = 115 meters
Time taken to cross each other when running in the same direction = 30 seconds.

Time taken to cross each other when running in opposite directions = 10 seconds.

Let’s denote:
Speed of Train A = 
𝑆
𝐴
S 
A
​
  m/s
Speed of Train B = 
𝑆
𝐵
S 
B
​
  m/s
1. When running in the same direction:
The relative speed = 
𝑆
𝐴
−
𝑆
𝐵
S 
A
​
 −S 
B
​
 .

The distance to be covered when they cross each other = length of Train A + length of Train B = 125 + 115 = 240 meters.

Using the formula:

2. When running in opposite directions:
The relative speed =

​
 .

Using the same formula:

3. Solving the equations:
From equations (1) and (2):

𝑆

𝑆

=

​
 −S

​
 =8
𝑆
𝐴
+
𝑆

=

S

​
 +S

​
 =24
Now, we can solve for 
𝑆

S

​
  and 
𝑆

S 
B
​
 .

Adding the equations:

(

(

=

(S

Substituting

Conclusion:
Speed of Train A: 16 m/s
Speed of Train B: 8 m/s
Answer:
Train A: 16 m/s (or 57.6 km/h)
Train B: 8 m/s (or 28.8 km/h)
From the options given:

16.8 (closest to Train A's speed)
The correct speeds should be 16 and 8.
