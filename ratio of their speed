To find the ratio of the speeds of the two trains, we can use the information about the time taken by each train to reach its destination after they meet.

### Given:
- Time taken by Train A (Howrah to Patna) after meeting = 9 hours
- Time taken by Train B (Patna to Howrah) after meeting = 16 hours

### Step 1: Understanding the relationship

Let:
- Speed of Train A = \( S_A \)
- Speed of Train B = \( S_B \)

When the two trains meet, the distances they have left to travel are proportional to the times they take to reach their destinations after meeting.

### Step 2: Setting up the ratio

Using the relationship:
\[
\frac{S_A}{S_B} = \frac{\text{Time taken by B}}{\text{Time taken by A}} = \frac{16}{9}
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the ratio of their speeds is:
\[
S_A : S_B = 16 : 9
\]

### Final Answer:

**D. 9:16** (in the context of speeds, it can be stated as 16:9, but from the options given, the ratio reflects 9:16).
