To find the ratio of the speeds of the two trains, let’s denote:

- Speed of Train A = \( S_A \)
- Speed of Train B = \( S_B \)

### Step 1: Calculate lengths of the trains

Using the information provided:

1. Train A crosses a man in 28 seconds.
2. Train B crosses a man in 18 seconds.

Let’s denote the lengths of the trains as:
- Length of Train A = \( L_A \)
- Length of Train B = \( L_B \)

Using the formula:
\[
\text{Length} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

From Train A:
\[
L_A = S_A \times 28
\]

From Train B:
\[
L_B = S_B \times 18
\]

### Step 2: When they cross each other

When the two trains cross each other, they cover the distance equal to the sum of their lengths in 26 seconds:
\[
L_A + L_B = (S_A + S_B) \times 26
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equations

From the lengths calculated:
\[
S_A \times 28 + S_B \times 18 = (S_A + S_B) \times 26
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
28S_A + 18S_B = 26S_A + 26S_B
\]

### Step 4: Rearranging the equation

Rearranging gives:
\[
28S_A - 26S_A = 26S_B - 18S_B
\]
\[
2S_A = 8S_B
\]
\[
\frac{S_A}{S_B} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]
Thus, we can express it as:
\[
\frac{S_A}{S_B} = 4:1
\]

### Conclusion

The ratio of their speeds is **4:1**.

### Final Answer:

**D. 4:1**
