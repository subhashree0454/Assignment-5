To determine how many minutes the train stops on average per hour, we can use the speeds provided.

### Given:
- Speed without stoppage = 72 km/h
- Speed with stoppage = 60 km/h

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent moving vs. stopping

1. **Distance covered in one hour without stoppage**:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 72 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Distance covered in one hour with stoppage**:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60 \text{ km}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent moving

When the train is moving without stoppage, it covers 72 km in 1 hour. However, with stoppages, it covers only 60 km in the same hour.

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent moving

The time spent moving in an hour with stoppage is:
\[
\text{Time moving} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{60 \text{ km}}{72 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{5}{6} \text{ hours} \approx 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the stopping time

The stopping time in an hour is:
\[
\text{Stopping Time} = 60 \text{ minutes} - 50 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer:

**C. 10 minutes**
